    <h1>Let's Help Those who Are <br> More In Need</h1>
      <p>We all should be kind and helpful and being helpful means we should be ready for lending a helping hand to anyone who needs it. Even if they are strangers, we should help in times of need.Lending a helping hand to a person shows how kind we are. Helping each other makes the world go round, and for centuries people have helped each other to live their lives. A society which has helpful members is a society which flourishes much faster than those which do not.</p>

            <h3>Food for a family</h3>
            <p>Safe food and water supplies are a major concern following a natural disaster such as a tornado, flood, hurricane or blizzard. Texas families who live in disaster-prone areas may benefit from being prepared in the event of disaster. Knowing how to safely handle food and water in the immediate few days after the disaster can reduce stress, worry and inconvenience.</p>

Flood-proof individual homesteads also serve as flood shelters for the individual family.</p>
